Requires:
- Windows (utilizes CMD prompt)

Installation:
* Requires Python to be installed
* Run install.bat to install all dependencies.
* Run run.bat, which will open up a cmd prompt.
Then, SCHEDULY, your CMD-line scheduling assistant, will guide you through the setup process.

# If install.bat doesn't work:
You will need to manually install the dependencies as python is not set on your PATH variable.
Run whatever command you usually do to install selenium (e.g. `pip install selenium`)

# If run.bat doesn't work:
You will need to manually run the python file (schoology.py) to utilize the program, as python is not set on your PATH variable.
