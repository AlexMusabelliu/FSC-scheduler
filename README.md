# Welcome to a new scheduler.
The Free Speech Club Scheduler, brought to you by the Free Speech Club (FSC), is a free, GUI-based scheduling program written entirely in Python.

The FSC Scheduler is designed to provide students a lightweight, adjustable scheduling system to join their online classes.

## Current support
The FSC Scheduler currently supports joining:
- Google Meet

And intends to support:
- Zoom
- Microsoft Teams
- And more!

## Installation:
* First, requires Python to be installed.
* Run install.bat to install all dependencies.
* Run run.bat, which will open up a GUI interface.
Then, the FSC Scheduler will guide you through the initial sign-up process.

### If install.bat doesn't work:
You will need to manually install the dependencies as python is not set on your PATH variable.
Run whatever command you usually do to install selenium (e.g. `pip install selenium`)

### If run.bat doesn't work:
You will need to manually run the python file (schoology.py) to utilize the program, as python is not set on your PATH variable.

## CLI Version
If you are more inclined to use a commandline interface (CLI), then please view the "master" branch.

# Upcoming features:
- Themes / Custom colors
- Support for more meeting types
- Support for extra login types
- .EXE for ease-of-use (may not be possible)
- Quick installation executable / batch file for easy installation
- Other beautification
